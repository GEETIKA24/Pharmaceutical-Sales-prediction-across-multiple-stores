Exploratory data analysis is the lifeblood of every meaningful machine-learning project. It helps us unravel the nature of the data and sometimes informs how you go about modelling. A careful exploration of the data encapsulates checking all available features, checking their interactions and correlation as well as their variability with respect to the target. 

In this task, We seek to explore the behaviour of customers in the various stores. Our goal is to check how some measures such as promos and opening of new stores affect purchasing behavior. 

To achieve this goal, We need to first clean the data. The data cleaning process will involve building pipelines to detect and handle outlier and missing data. This is particularly important because you donâ€™t want to skew our analysis.
